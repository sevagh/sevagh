:brain: My favorite topic is music demixing (:heart: [MDX](https://mdx-workshop.github.io/)). My ongoing projects are:

* [xumx-sliCQ](https://github.com/sevagh/xumx-sliCQ), an Open-Unmix variant with the [sliCQT](https://github.com/sevagh/nsgt) that I submitted to [MDX 21](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/music-demixing-challenge-ismir-2021)
    * [YouTube link to my presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TntPVZ4ajIk&t=2448s) on xumx-sliCQ at the AICrowd MDX 21 townhall
    * [Tentative ideas to improve xumx-sliCQ](https://gitlab.com/sevagh/xumx_slicq_extra/-/tree/main/sliceq22-ideas) for MDX 22+
* The OnAir Music [dataset](https://github.com/OnAir-Music/OnAir-Music-Dataset) and [Python library](https://github.com/OnAir-Music/onair-py), a new dataset for music demixing research
